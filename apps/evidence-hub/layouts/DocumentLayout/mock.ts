MaPS has a considerable evidence base relating to debt advice customers. However, most of this relates to the pre-pandemic environment and before the recent increases in the cost of living. These changes to the economy and society will have an impact on the cohorts of people seeking debt advice and how it will need to be delivered. MaPS is seeking to build more up-to-date evidence through independent insight gathered via research projects. This report is designed to support MaPS’s decision making for future rounds of debt advice commissioning. It sets out key themes and challenges facing debt advice providers and suggests some areas of consideration to prompt debate and discussion ahead of the any commercial activity.',
